X-PLANE General LICENSEversion 1.011.0     Preamble:        The intent of this document is to state the conditions under        which an X-Plane related Package may be modified and        distributed, such that the Copyright Holder maintains        some semblance of artistic control over its development.        1.1     Definitions:        "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed        by the Copyright Holder                "Derivative" refers to files created through the modification        if files contained in the Package.                 "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or        copyrights for the package.                "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or        distributing this Package.                "For Sale" means that a fee is charged for the distribution        of the Package.                "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item.        It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute        it under the same conditions they received it.2.0 Conditions:                It is the Copyright Holder's responsibility to adequately convey        which of the conditions outlined in Section 2 apply to the Package.2.1     The Package may not be redistributed, Derivatives may not be redistributed                You may not redistribute the Package or any Derivatives as                a whole or in part.2.2     The Package may be redistributed for non-commercial purposes only,        Derivatives may not be redistributed                You may redistribute the an unmodified copy of the Package for                non-commercial purposes only.                2.3     The Package and Derivatives may be redistributed for non-commercial        purposes only                You may redistribute the Package and derivatives in a manner that                would not be considered For Sale as as long as you do at least                ONE of the following:                                a) make your modifications Freely Available such as by                        posting said modifications to ftp.x-plane.com or by placing                        the modifications on a major archive site such as The                        X-Plane Aircraft Registry or X-Plane Scenery Registry, or by                        allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications                        in the Package.                                                b) rename all modified files so the names do not conflict                        with the files contained in the Package, and provide a text                        file that clearly documents how the files differ from the                        Package.                                                c) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright                        Holder.2.4     The Package may be redistributed For Sale, Derivatives may not        be redistributed                You may redistribute only the Package For Sale as long as it appears                in its exact original form.2.5 The Package and Derivatives may be redistributed For Sale                You may redistribute the Package and any derivatives For Sale                as long as you                                a) include unmodified copies of all documentation, licenses,                        and other documents contained in the Package, and                                b) rename all modified files so the names do not conflict                        with the files contained in the Package, and                        provide a text file that clearly documents how the files                        differ from the Package.                        If these conditions can not be met, other distribution arrangements                can be made with the Copyright Holder.3.0     Exceptions:        The following are exceptions to the conditions stated in Section 2.3.1     Flaps and Airfoils                                        All flap (*.flp) and airfoil (*.afl) files not belonging to                a specific Package are to remain in the Public Domain and are                not covered under the distribution restrictions stated in                Section 2.                                                For an airfoil to belong to a specific Package its name must                match that of the Packaged aircraft (example:  "Cessna 172.afl").                                Airfoils with names reflecting their design such as "NACA 2142"                and "Clark Y" are considered to be generic and are not covered                 under the distribution restrictions stated in Section 2.                4.0     Warranty        This package is provided "as is" and without any express or        implied warranties, including, without limitation, the implied        warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.The End
