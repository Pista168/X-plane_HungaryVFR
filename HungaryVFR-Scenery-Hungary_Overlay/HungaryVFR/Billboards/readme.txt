TM LIBRARY: Billboards HD vol 1 v1.0 for X-Plane v11 *FREEWARE EDITION* by Teschmacher (c) 2018

Installation: unzip and place this folder in your /X-Plane 11/Custom Scenery/ folder

Use WED and/or the Overlay Editor to place the billboard objects in your airport scenery.

Free use, *.png texture image file alteration and distribution of any of these objects from this library is allowed as long as the airport/scenery
you are using remains *FREEWARE* for X-Plane only!

WARNING! Licensing is required if you intend to use any of these objects of this library in a payware/commercial airport scenery project for X-Plane you will want to sell.
Please contact machertesch@gmail.com for licensing inquiries in order to receive a custom version and an exclusively licensed copy of this library for your commercial payware scenery/airport project for X-Plane.

If you happen to have found this file inside a commercial payware airport scenery for X-plane you have just purchased, please report this violation to machertesch@gmail.com
For your information: In a licensed copy of this library for a commercial/payware airport scenery project for X-Plane, the billboard objects should appear clean without displaying the 'TM LIBRARY' logo under each billboard panel.

X-Plane v11 & HDR is required, the billboards are self-lit dynamically using HDR lighting. No *_LIT* textures are used in these objects.

The original .png texture file size are 2048x2048, you may increase or decrease the size of the .png files if you want more or less resolution of the 
images graphics the billboards are displaying: 

Use any image editing software to edit out the displayed content and resize the texture image files in the rule of a square as following:

-256x256
-512x512
-1024x1024
-2048x2048
-4096x4096


For further performance and FPS optimization in X-Plane, conversion of the texture .png file to .dds is recommended, In order to have the X-Plane billboard .obj 
file correctly find and display the correct texture .dds file, you may have to edit out the .obj file line 6 using a text editor and rename  
'TEXTURE <texture_file_name.png> text string line to the appropriate *.dds texture file name that is related to the billboard xpl *.obj file you want to use for
each billboard .obj. 

If you want to use multiple instances of a billboard of the same size to display different custom graphics/message/advertisement of your choice, 
simply make as many copies as you need of the concerned billboard *.obj file AND the related *.png texture file, then edit out the .obj file and rename the 
texture filename(s) accordingly.  

for example: 

BILLBOARD_DF_MEDIUM_001.obj -> texture filename: BILLBOARD_DF_MEDIUM_001.png
BILLBOARD_DF_MEDIUM_002.obj -> texture filename: BILLBOARD_DF_MEDIUM_002.png
BILLBOARD_DF_MEDIUM_003.obj -> texture filename: BILLBOARD_DF_MEDIUM_003.png
etc
