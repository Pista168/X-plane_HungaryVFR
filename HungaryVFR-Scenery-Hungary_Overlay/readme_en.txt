***** INSTALLATION *****

Copy the contents of the zip into "X-Plane folder/Custom Scenery" directory.

***** COMPATIBILITY *****

X-Plane version: X-Plane 11.00+
Compatibility with other sceneries: yes
Known compatibility problems: if you are using other w2xp sceneries - e.g. SimHeaven europe,  SimHeaven forests, SimHeaven X-Europe - 
its important to put our overlay above these overlays, so our overlay will be active (out from Hungary the other overlays will be active)

e.g. for Scenery_packs.ini:

SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/HungaryVFR-Scenery-Hungary_Overlay/
SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/simHeaven_Forests_Europe/
SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/w2xp_Europe_mix/


***** REQUIREMENTS *****

Libraries listed below are required: 
Copy the libraries into "X-Plane folder/Custom Scenery" folder.

- HungaryVFR Library
- OpenSceneryX Library
- R2-library
- w2xp world models (http://simheaven.com/simdownloads/w2xp-world-models/)
- europe library (http://simheaven.com/europe-library/)

Its highly recommended to use SimHeaven's europe_net scenery, a Scenery_packs.ini example with europe_net scenery:

SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/w2xp_Europe_net/
SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/HungaryVFR-Scenery-Hungary_Overlay/
SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/simHeaven_Forests_Europe/
SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/w2xp_Europe_mix/

***** SCENERY_PACKS.ini *****

For the correct operation your SCENERY_PACKS.ini must be correct, if the scenery should not show up, 
try editing the scenery_packs.ini file inside the Custom Scenery folder.
