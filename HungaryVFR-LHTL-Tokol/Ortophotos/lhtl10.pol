A850DRAPED_POLYGON#This is a ".pol" file - it defines the look of a draped polygon from a DSF or DSF overlay.#Lines starting with # are the comments.  The first three lines are a standard header for# this file.#The draped polygon takes the shape of the underlying base mesh and changes the way it#looks.#Layer-group command.  This command defines where in the "stacking order" of the scenery#this polygon will appear.  Negative numbers indicate a number of layers UNDER an#element...positive nubmers indicate going over an element.  The range of numbers can#be from -1 to -5 or 1 to 5.#In this case we are going under the "airports" layer.  This assures that this#polygon will go under all parts of the airports (blast pads, runways, taxiways, #shoulders, etc.) but will be above any base terrain, beaches, etc.LAYER_GROUP airports -1#The TEXTURE command defines the texture we will use.  The file ksbd_alpha.png is our texture #file.  Where did this file come from?  I downloaded an orthophoto from the USGS and then#used photoshop to apply an alpha mask to "crop out" part of the surface area.#You can change this line to ust TEXTURE ksbd.png to see the original square orthophoto.#The texture is a partial file path that is found relative to the directory containing#this .pol file.TEXTURE_NOWRAP lhtl10.ddsTEXTURE_LIT_NOWRAP lhtl10_LIT.png
#The SCALE command defines the repeating for the texture.  If we have texture coordinates#in the DSF (we do in our case) then this command is ignored.  If the texture is going to#repeat like a land-class texture, then we would want this.SCALE 25 25 #The SURFACE command defines the physical properties of the overlay polygon.  In this#case we will make the surface act like grass!SURFACE grass
